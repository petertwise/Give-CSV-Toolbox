# Give-CSV-Toolbox
A utility plugin to export donations and custom form fields to CSV.

# squarecandy fork

I added two custom fields of my own.

If you've added items to the `$payment_meta` array and need to export it, you can
add your fields by making changes as I did. Search for comments marked "Add
Custom Fields" in `/includes/give-csv-toolbox-exporter.php` and
`/includes/give-csv-toobox-settings.php`.

This fork is compatible with squarecandy's [Give Simple Fields](https://github.com/squarecandy/give-simple-fields) plugins.
